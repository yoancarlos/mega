AID13,CASCADE RS,Application,Not set,Critical,Critical,Processing of RegisteredShares in CSC business,Critical,Internal,onboarding,CASCADE RS,Critical,LE13,"CASCADE-RS includes all functions related to the processing of Registered Shares in CSC business.
The functionality of CASCADE-RS can be split into two main aspects:
·      Routing of instructions from banks to issuers (of registered shares) and vice versa (where the message handling itself is provided by LIMA) including the verification of instructions.
 
·      Detailed position keeping/ handling for banks on shareholder level, meaning banks are mirroring the registered shares positions of their customers’ accounts within CASCADE-RS .
 
The functions in detail are:
Registration of shareholders:
Following a capital increase or the initial issue of registered shares shareholders have to be initially registered. The bank instruction contains the shareholder data (name, address, date of birth etc.), the number of shares and references the underlying capital increase. A message is sent to the issuer and the CASCADE-RS position for the shareholder is created.
 
Re-registration:
The re-registration instruction results from a trade in registered shares. It contains the data of the buyer (name, address, date of birth etc.) and the number of shares. 
Then a matching of previous shareholder positions to the re-registration instructions is performed (3 times a day).
A message is sent to the issuer and the CASCADE-RS position for the shareholder is created at time the positive feedback has been received from the issuer.
 
De-registration:
The de-registration instruction results from a trade in registered shares. It references the seller and contains the number of shares being sold. The referenced shareholder position in CASCADE-RS is freed and the information (shareholder id and amount) held in the Previous Shareholder Pool until it is used by the matching process for re-registrations  (see above).  
This function is closely integrated with the CASCADE system. 
For mass de-registrations CASCADE-RS provides a function to de-register all positions of one security or of one bank across securities. This is used for example for squeeze-outs.
 
Update of shareholder data:
In case the personal data of a shareholder (name, address) changes, the bank enters an Update Shareholder Data instruction. As not the complete shareholder data is kept in CASCADE-RS, an update of data might or might not occur. Anyhow the instruction is routed to the issuer.  
Instructions can be entered on single ISIN level (via data transfer or online) or for all ISINs within one shareowner-account (only online).
 
Cross border securities Transfer
Securities Transfers are possible in the link between Monte Titoli, Euroclear France, DTC, APK and CBF.  For transfers of holdings from other CSDs to CBF messages are sent to the share registers, the additional holdings at CBF are reflected using a technical shareholder. For transfers from CBF to other CSDs the registered shares holdings at CBF are reduced by de-registering shareholders in the unregistered positons queue. Messages for those de-registrations are sent to the share registers. 
 
Transfer of registered positions:
In case the bank account of a shareholder changes this change has to be reflected in CASCADE-RS. 
Two kinds of this instruction type have to be differentiated: Internal and external, where internal means, the shareholder account changes within the same bank organisation and external meaning a shareholder has transferred his account to a different bank. 
Based on this instruction the positions in CASCADE-RS are shifted and an information message is transferred to the issuer.
This function is closely integrated with the CASCADE system.
For mass account changes, which occur at bank mergers or when the accounts within one bank are restructured, CASCADE RS provides a function (RS CEDAR) to generate instructions to transfer the registered positions impacted. The input for this function might be a general algorithm or a migration file from banks containing each position with its old and new identification.
 
Corporate actions:
As the CASCADE-RS positions reflect the bank positions on a more detailed level, all corporate actions changing the amount of shares have to be performed on the CASCADE-RS positions. E.g. in case of re-nomination the shareholder positions have to be altered in the defined ratio.
This function is triggered by the KADI system.
 
Deposit/Delivery of individual certificates:
In case individual certificates for a certain equity still exist, a deposit or delivery to respectively from CSC might occur. For deposits in registered shares the certificate numbers and shareholder data is being verified against the information provided by the issuer. In case of successful verification shareholder positions are created and a message is sent to the issuer.
This function is triggered by the VAULTS system.
 
External Reconciliation:
Besides the internal reconciliation CASCADE-RS provides a function to reconcile its shareholder positions against the ones contained in the issuer’s share register. This is done on request of the issuer. The information can either be provided on an individual basis or regularly (daily, weekly, monthly etc.) 
 
Capital increase information:
Whenever a capital increase takes place for an equity contained in CASCADE-RS this has to be reflected synchronously within CASCADE-RS and the affected share register. In CASCADE-RS – triggered by the VAULTS system – a position is generated reflecting the amount of shares waiting for registration.
In order to ensure synchronicity with the share register a message is sent containing the capital increase data. 
 
Previous shareholders information:
As CASCADE-RS keeps the information of shareholders already being de-registered by the bank but only transfers this information combined with a re-registration for another shareholder the deregistration will reach the share register days or weeks after the deregistration has been entered by the bank. Therefore CASCADE-RS provides an information file with all shareholders marked for de-registration (“previous shareholders”) to share-registers .
The information can on request either be provided on an individual basis or regularly (daily, weekly, monthly etc.). 
 
Information on unregistered bank positions
In order to inform issuers about the volume of unregistered positions per bank a fix format file is produced on request and sent out to the issuers.
 
Technical/nominee re-registration:
In order to immediately (on a daily basis) de-register all shareholders marked for re-registration CASCADE-RS provides a function for registering a bank specific (on bank’s request) nominee or common technical shareholder for all unregistered positions. Issuers can request this function.
 
Master and Control Data
For entry of issuer master data and control data CASCADE-RS offers an online interface.
 
Queries and report of holdings
CASCADE-RS offers the online entry of requests of LIMA Queries or report of holdings. Bank users can define the range of holdings they want to receive information on, e.g. ISIN or account number range can be specified. LIMA queries provide the information in a file format ready for further processing, the report of holdings is a printable report.   
 
CASCADE-RS consists of Online and Batch. Online functions being used for instruction entry and information retrieval on instructions or positions. They can be used by banks directly and provide real time information.
Instructions alternatively can be entered using the LIMA interface or  S.W.I.F.T. Additionally there is an online transaction restricted for internal usage (KCEZ). This one is used for entry of RS specific master data and for controlling/triggering of processes (external reconsiliation, exclusion of certain ISINs from re-registration).
Main processing within CASCADE-RS occurs in Batch mode.
 
As mentioned above CASCADE-RS is closely integrated into the CBF applications, especially CASCADE, VAULTS, KADI.  
 
For master data it uses the common applications WSS (securities) and KUSTA (customers – banks and issuers).

In detail the following business areas and instruction types are supported:
 
Liquidity Management (P6)
·            Reservation instructions:
They can be created manually by using the Cash Lifecycle online functionality. Beside this, standing instructions can be used to trigger the automatic creation of reservation instructions based on a fixed cash amount defined in KUSTA or the cash requirement calculated by the Cash Forecast application.  Reservation instructions can also be entered in applications of Deutsche Bundesbank and are in this case forwarded electronically to Cash Lifecycle.
 
·            Reservation Reversal instructions:
Those are created by the application to reverse the original reservation booking at the end of the settlement cycle. In addition, dependant on the settlement result, Utilisation or Payout Instructions are created.
 
·            Utilisation instructions are automatically generated in case of a negative settlement result for an account. 
 
·            Payout instructions are automatically generated in case of a positive settlement result for an account. 
 
·            Funding Transfers can be used to transfer cash liquidity from cash funding accounts to cash settlement accounts. They will be produced automatically based on rules defined by customers via online
 
·            Realignment Transfers are used to transfer remaining cash liquidity after settlement from cash settlement accounts back to cash funding accounts. They will be produced automatically based on rules defined by customers via online
 
·            Market Allocation Instructions:
These are built on market allocation rules defined by customers to transfer cash from a CSA to a MAA. Should the definitions for MAAs in KUSTA not be in sync with CL’s own rules, the CL rules will be updated accordingly to enforce their consistency.
 
·            Market Reversal Instructions
Reversal of the market allocation instruction based on CASCADE balances
 
X-CSD Instructions
For pending purchases these are created based on pending cash amounts delivered by CASCADE.
For new purchases these are created based on the difference between the balances of the Market allocation and Market reversal instructions
 
Cash Instructions (P6)
·      Custody Cash instructions (NTP):
These are generated by the Cash Lifecycle system based on information delivered by the KADI application.
 
Cash Instructions (P3):

SPOC: ISO15022 (via S.W.I.F.T., MQ and FT) and XML (via FT):
 
Beneath LIMA file transfer an interface to the S.W.I.F.T. network has been developed since 1997. For this reason a connectivity layer was built which is called SPOC (single point of contact). This layer offers the opportunity to connect new interfaces and applications in an easy way. The conversion to or from the external formats is done by a Win2008 R2 server  application called X-Gen. X-Gen is a conversion engine offered by DION Global Solutions , which is an external contractor. The external formats are mapped to a general, fixed sized or XML based application format, which can be easily accessed by the applications.
 
Today S.W.I.F.T. (inbound and outbound) is connected as an interface to SPOC. Furthermore reports (statement of transactions, statement of holdings) are sent via file transfer by using the SPOC infrastructure. 
 
In 2008 an additional interface via MQ to and from customers has been implemented for realtime communication purposes.
 
The current S.W.I.F.T., MQ and FT interfaces offer the customer to send messages in the format of ISO15022.
 
All SPOC messages received from CBF customers will be stored and archived for a time periode of 10 years via MERVA journal, z/OS file storager or LDMS.
 
The SPOC supports a power of attorney (PoA) functionality, which allows a sender to instruct for different customers (MASA). The following functionality can be used by messages sent by CBF’s customers. 
 
Customers using this file transfer, MQ and S.W.I.F.T. interfaces can send the following message types:
 
CASCADE:
-   instructions: 
–       deliver against and free of payment
–       receive against and free of payment
–       position transfer

ISO15022 via MQ
 
Since September 2007 SPOC has been enhanced by a new MQ interface in order to link the collateral systems of CBF (XEMAC) and CBL (CmaX). The communication is done in realtime on basis of ISO15022 compatible message formats:
 
-   Triparty Collateral Instruction
-   Triparty Collateral Status and Processing Advice
 
Since July 2008 this MQ link is also used for CBL-CBF interoperability in order to exchange settlement messages with CBL on a realtime basis. This link connects the settlement platforms Creation and CASCADE via connectivity systems HUB and SPOC. Beside functional information also technical messages for ACK/NAK handling is exchanged.
 
Since July 2008 MQ is also used for the cash link to CBL for foreign currency transactions. 
 
 
 
Monitoring:
 
The data exchange of LIMA can be observed by the IMS transactions MAMJ (ISO7775 FT and ISO15022 S.W.I.F.T., FT and MQ via SPOC).

Creation:Direct via LIMA
 
A further LIMA functionality is called “Creation:Direct via LIMA” which acts as a router to CBL. By this Interface German domestic customers can receive Creation:Direct reports from CBL via CBF. The advantage is that customers do not have to establish a network connection to CBL if they have already an existing one to CBF. So far customers can receive various settlement reports in XML-, ISO-, PDF-and CSV-Format. The file transfer can be monitored for the customer and CBF/CBL customer services in MAMJ (new function code FC). CBF customers can also use this interface to send instructions for Creation via LIMA in ISO15022 format.
 
LIMA forwards pricing information to the CASH2 billing system and statistic information to Statistics (MIS) for further reporting.
 
DDR:
 
In 2010 a new file transfer interface to CBL was created to send MT535 and MT536 from CSD’s and depositories to DDR for reconciliation purposes.
 
WSS:
 
Since November 2011 LIMA/SPOC also provides X-Gen conversion services for WSS (security master data) on a XML basis.
 
WM:
 
Since 2012 LIMA/SPOC also routes MT564 and MT568 messages from RS and Custody to WM and stores them in MAMJ.
 
SPOC Gateway:
 
In 2014 a new connectivity component has been launched which will act as central interface between the CBF backends and master data sysems on the one side and T2S related systems (administrated by CBL) on the other side (such as PM-CSD and T2S-I). The underlying format to CBL-systems is so called “ISO20022+” which consists of a fixed length control part at the beginning followed ba an original ISO20022 message. The interface to CBF internal backends and static data systems is implemented on basis of fixed length formats (Copybooks) and sub module technology. The message transfer between systems on CBF side and PM-CSD/T2SI can be monitored via new SPOC transaction MAMX. The message conversation from copybooks to ISO20022+ is done by X-Gen engine. The SPOC Gasteway also offers a generic interface to PI² for exceptional handling.

STOP sanctions screening
 
In 2014 a new interface to MICOS has been launched for sanctions screening purposes. All messages received from sustomers which were received via FT, SW or MQ and which are targeted to application CASCADE will be sent to MICOS/TCM for realtime sanctions screening before it may be processed by CASCADE. The interface to MICOS is implemented on MQ basis and underlying formatis so called “ISO15022+” which consists of a fixed length control part at the beginning followed by an oringal ISO15022 message. The message transfer between SPOC and MICOS can be monitored via SPOC transaction MAMJ.
SPOC also offers an interface to MICOS for transaction that have been entered via CASCADE online. For these transaction SPOC will generate a MT578 via X-Gen conversion engine, snt it to MICOS and forwards the screening results back to CASCADE.

AID67,LION,Application,Not set,Critical,Critical,Lifecycle Management for Stock Exchange trades,Critical,Internal,onboarding,LION,Critical,LE27,"Description of the business functions supported by the application
 
LION is the application used for the life cycle management of stock exchange trades (non-CCP).
 
Stock exchange trades are routed from Deutsche Börse (XONTRO) and CCP application once a day via file transfer into the LION application. Customers of Clearstream can manage their positions by using the LION online or file transfer facility.

Besides the blocking and unblocking of trades LION also foresees the possibility to split the settlement of a trade into various parts (partial delivery-> Teilebelieferung).
 
Dependent on the underlying position, due trades are routed for settlement from LION to the CASCADE Settlement Engine (for CSC business) three times a day and to ICSD Systems (Settlement/Cash Services) (for NCSC business) twice a day.
 
The settlement result is routed back from these applications to LION where the positions (open trades) of the customers are updated, and the information about settled trades is forwarded to the “Settlement reporting.
For information to the customers LION provides – in addition to the available online queries – various reports (e.g. “LIST OF PENDING S.E. TRANSACTIONS”) and messages  for “Pending Stock Exchange Trades” (MT537) and “Settlement Confirmations” (MT 545/547) via LIMA (S.W.I.F.T.)

AID68,LMS,Application,Not set,Major,Major,Lending Management System,Minor,External,onboarding,LMS,Major,LE28,"Clearstream Banking offers its customers an automatic fails lending for deliveries against payment. This is done by a lending system, which core part is the Lending Management System LMS.
Clearstream Banking does not join the settlement lending itself, but acts as an agent between borrower and lender. This model is embedded in existing settlement structures (CASCADE, LION).
The lending system supports two business types: settlement management (automatic lending) and strategic lending.
 
Clearstream Banking initiates and returns settlement management trades without involving the customers particularly. This happens through an automatic allocation in which trade suggestions are generated (considering the stock of potential lenders and the fails of potential borrowers). These trade suggestions are listed in the “Dispo Mask” and can be changed if needed. Automatic lending trades are automatically returned by LMS.
 
Strategic trades (except KAGplus) are entered in LMS by the trader manually. LMS exports the openings and the returns to the backoffice at the requested date.
In the same way, LMS allows the management of collaterals, virtual positions and trades with virtual positions.
 
Since 2014 the sources of FX rates can be prioritized and Rights can be traded within the KAGplus business.
 
Since 2013 loan trades can be opend using a non EUR price of EUR. For this functionality multicurrency prices and FX rates are provided to LMS by WSS. Ability a lot af Aditionally new reporting features were implemented.
Master data export to Smonitor and new reporting channel via Secure Copy and Secure File Transfer have been prepared for using.
Since November 2012 information about collateral for LMS entered in CMAX is available electronically and can be made visible in detail on LMS reports.
 
Since April 2012 Reuters prices are available. For the purpose of extension of the strategic lending business and lendigspecialized trade entry for GSF London has been made possible.
 
Since November 2011 additional corporate actions are available in LMS for automatic processing. Automatic fee calculation in LMS has been enhanced to the needs of the billing process.
 
Since May 2011 settlement on CBL settlement platform creation is possible. Xemac collateral positions have been made visible in detail in LMS reporting.
 
Since June 2010 the LMS trade number is available in MT544/MT546 CASCADE Settlement Confirmations and MT536 CSS for reconciliation purposes on customer side. 
 
Since November 2009 all trade openings are checked against pre-defined eligibility criteria. Eligibility baskets can be defined on trade type level on the loan side and on customer level on the collateral side. The definition of the eligibility baskets is based on security criteria delivered by WSS. Since September 2010 the EGCP and EGCPX basket definitions are available for eligibility basket definition in LMS. Additionally, an additional interface allows the upload and usage of customized eligibility lists for eligibility basket definition.
 
Since all lending transactions are now booked with immediate finality in the settlement engine of CASCADE due to the introduction of New Daytime Processing, additional exposure management functionality was implemented in LMS. Every loan opening which is sent to CASCADE for settlement must now be collateralized in advance.
 
Since November 2008 for a part of the strategic business (funds lending: KAGplus; KAG = “Kapitalanlagegesellschaft) customers can send instructions to LMS in ISO15022 messages MT540 and MT542 (fully automated interface) or in comma separated text files (semi-automated interface). For the position based KAGplus business lenders can send their lendable assets where borrowers can send requests against. In the automated matching process LMS matches holdings against demand considering predefined customer relationships.
In the instruction based KAGplus business both lender and borrower send prearranged instructions which match in LMS.
KAGplus customers can order intra-day reporting for KAGplus business using ISO15022 messages MT548. Since November 2009 also the automatic cancellation of instructions and trades via ISO15022 messages is possible.
 
In addition LMS carries out a daily fee calculation, in which the open lending trades are considered.
 
Since March 2007 after SDS1 LMS releases Collateral automatically if the affected securities were short in the SDS1 batch settlement or will have a corporate action event on next value date. The collateral substitution must be done still manually.
 
Since November 2006 SOFDIS settlement of all lending and collateral instructions (RTS mode as well as non-RTS) is possible. 
 
Since June 2005 LMS allows the generation of all reports automatically.

The underlying business event is a transfer of deposits from one financial institution to another. In this case the financial institution from which the deposit is transferred has to provide the receiver institution with information e.g. about dates and prices of the transferred holdings at which they were bought.
Additionally another message type is covered by Taxbox, which allows the transfer of losses summarized for one account.
 
The main functions of the Taxbox are:
·      Receiving messages from banks concerning information relevant for calculating withholding tax.
·      Perform validations on messages received to ensure formal consistency. Validation results are sent back to the sending institution.
·      Storing messages in backend database.
·      Determine the receiver of the message
·      Bundle and send out messages to the receiving institutions at defined sending cycles 
 
The functions in detail are:
Business Validation:
Incoming messages are validated against business rules, i.e. correct and consistent values according to plausibility definitions etc.. According feedback is sent back to the sender. 
Routing Table functions:
Taxbox uses a so called Routing Table to determine the receiver of a message. The address ID used in the messages is either  the German Banc Identifier Code (“Bankleitzahl” – BLZ) or the S.W.I.F.T. Banc Identifier Code BIC. This  has to be matched to a CBF customer ID (“KV-Nummer”) to whom the message will be sent to.
This matching information is stored in the Routing Table. 
Initially the information is loaded with information received from customers in a standard CSV-file.
Afterwards the maintenance is done via an online function. 
Routing Table entries contain a valid from and valid to date in order to allow even future entries.
The Routing Table online function is only available for CBF users.
An export of the Routing Table in CSV-file format is provided weekly for Business Operations.
 
Message storage:
Messages are stored in a database, adding some organisational fields to the message, i.e. status, date and time etc.
 
Message online service:
Messages can be retrieved online for one year by entering some search criteria such as period of time, sender, receiver etc. 
This function is available for CBF and customer users. Customer users’ access is restricted to messages either sent or received by them.
Additionally the online function allows selecting messages to be resent as a copy of the message. This service is only available for CBF users.
 
Message preparation:
At defined sending cycles (currently four times a day), messages are read out of the message database, checked for completeness, bundled per receiving customer and sent out.

AID139,TEX,Application,Not set,Major,Major,"TEX is the custom-build trading platform from 360T for trading and execution of FX, Money Market and Interest Rate Derivative products. Furthermore it can be seen as a SaaS solution, as it offers also white-labelling features and supports multi-tenancy, multi-product configuration.",Major,Internal,onboarding,TEX,Major,,"TEX is the overall name of the 360T platform. It connects the Buy Side clients, which are either Corporates (ca 1000), Banks (ca 400), Asset Managers (ca 100) or Broker-Dealers (<5) and the Sell-Side, which are mainly banks, providing the liquidity.

Nearly 90% of the trades are in the RFS FX spot, forward and swap area, where the Buy-Side requests an offer for a trade from banks/market makers, with whom the customer has a relationship. Liquidity provider answer by providing an offer. The system compares and sorts these offers and the client can decide , which offer to accept. Market makers on the other hand cannot see, which offer the customer accepted. The market maker  receives monthly reports, indicating in which range they are. This trading model is described as RfS (Request-for-Stream).

A different approach is ESP (Executable Streaming Price), where clients can subscribe to a channel, where market makers are constantly streaming their offers for fixed sizes (e.g. 1 M, 3M, ...). Clients can see the spread and decide there for the best offer. In both system all participants can set limits, which get automatically processed, once a corresponding price is offered.

Once a trade is made, the TEX platform generates a Deal Confirmation, which can be automaticcaly  passed on to the treasury / settlement systems. The settlement itself is not done by TEX. Neither any position or risk management (appart from some limits), as 360T is not acting as a central counterparty.

Technically the TEX platform is developed in pure Java and completely by 360T. External libraries are avoided whenever possible. The frontend is currently using Swing, but there is an effort to replace this with JavaFX. In the same move a lot of the business logic will be moved from client side to server side.

TEX can also be configured to be used within one company or for interbank marketplaces, which is called I-TEX. The main frontends are called RfS for Request-for-Stream dealing and SuperSonic Trader (SST) for Executable Streamed Pricing dealing.
Furthermore there is the Market Maker Cockpit (MMC), where the banks can manage the pricing and a Auto Dealing Suite (ADS).

As the platform is constantly evolving, a new version is developed called EMS (Execution Management System), which should unify all the different services into one and which is introducing a more flexible data model.

Instructions are given via CASCADE Lifecycle to CASADE Settlement Engine to be settled by the RTS-method or in the STD settlement processes. Settlement Reporting, LIMA Queries are available as the customer front end for information regarding settled deposit/withdrawal instructions.
 
Deposits and withdrawals are integrated in Settlement Services as a special instruction type. The functionality for the management of the instructions during its lifecycle (e.g. amendment, cancellation, 4 eyes principle,) provided for deposits/withdrawals is aligned with the functionality for OTC-instructions.
 
In general within the term “deposits/withdrawals”, not only the deliveries of physical single and global certificates into and out of the vault are considered but also new issues and the provision and reduction of market volatility “mark up/down”on variable global up-to-certificates  (“Neuzulassung”, “Re-/Valutierung”, “Teilreduzierung”, “Reduktion Rahmennominale”). 
In addition the functionality to care for the special workflow of an instruction concerning physical certificates is provided (e.g. receipt of certificates at the counter, release the deposit instruction for settlement with 4-eyes-principle, confirming the receipt of certificates in the vault, assignment/amendment of certificate numbers to deposit and withdrawal instructions, pre-setting the denominations for batch assignment of certificate numbers to physical withdrawal instructions, confirming each of the packages of a split deposit, calculation of insurance value and transport costs).

4.    ECHO
The current event handling functionality is separated in 4 sub-processes, which are defined as follows:
First sub-process “Preparation”:
Producing event-notification lists in advance and automatic block stocks report for the preparation of vault related event-processing.
 
Second sub-process “Inventory” (batch):
Producing Vaults inventory report.“Copy” the concerned CARAD-stocks as the basic stocks for handling the event. This process takes place one day before execution date.
 
Third sub-process “Reconciliation” (on-line or automatically in the batch): 
Reconciliation action compares the position at the NOSTRO accounts with the physical security amounts.
Online: Information about securities to be reconciled and status of reconciliation. Vault staff confirms the reconciliation. If necessary input/amendment of the “copied” stocks. The result is automatically documented by four Online-Printing reports (incl. special information for deductions).
Batch: Automatic reconciliation for non-effective securities (with/without deductions) and for effective securities (without deductions) where there is no difference of amounts to be detected. 
The online process takes place at the earliest at the execution date. The batch process occurs 1 day before execution date and is included in the second sub-process.
 
Forth sub-process “Delivery/Destroying of certificates”: 
This process involves creating additional reports for documentation purposes, for support of manual processes and for distribution to the lead managers/paying agents respecting their format requests and the securities and event related format requirements.

Participants use Controls screens to retrieve workflow information regarding their deposit/withdrawal instructions. Via ECHO they receive the documents provided by the fourth process.
 
 
{Overall additional services}
The following additional vault services are overall provided by all or parts of the vault applications:
 
 
·       Admission service level ""segregated CSC deposit"" (""Vorratslagerverwaltung"").
Non-endorsed investment certificates (mainly physical single certificates) with a regular securities identification number are stored separately from CSC and are segregated per customer on subaccounts (bank of deposit for the relevant investment fund) on a contractual basis. 

Those certificates are not on the market yet and have to be physically separated in the vaults. 

The first deposit is done by a normal deposit instruction type, with the advice that the securities have to be credited under a segregated CSD deposit account. 

By receiving specific customer instructions, it is possible to change this form of deposit into CSC. For transfers in or out of the segregated CSC deposit, the vault D/W-function Withdrawal is used with the target account which has been explicitly advised by the customer. The target account can either be the regular CSC account/position type (transfer from SCSC to CSC) or the SCSC account/position type (transfer from CSC to SCSC).

7.    Safekeeper-ProLog
The Safekeeper ProLog Application supports the business processes of CBF in its roles as the CSK (Common Safekeeper) and LVO (LuxCSD Vault Operator)
for Clearstream Luxemburg eg. LuxCSD. It provides all functionality of the workflows regarding the business process from start to end of life of a New Global Note eg. LuxCSD Notes. Several types of messages for the interface communication can be processed (SWIFT, email, fax, fileAct). The application fulfils all documentation requirements within its Logbook functionality.
 
Prolog for business processes of CSK:
 
As of end of June 2006, issuers of international debt securities can opt for a new form of global note, the NGN, to issue international debt securities in global bearer form. The characteristics of the NGN are the same as the existing CGN, except that:
•       the NGN only applies to debt securities in bearer form; 
•       the ICSD records are used to determine the outstanding amount of the issue rather than physical annotations on the global note itself;
•       issuers must sign an agreement with the ICSDs to request acceptance of their securities;
•       if transmitted electronically to the entity appointed as CSK, the NGN will need to be effectuated by the CSK upon authorisation from the issuer.
 
 
Each security will be serviced by a Common Service Provider (CSP) which will be in charge of providing asset services to the ICSDs and a Common Safekeeper (CSK) which will be in charge of safekeeping the NGN throughout its life, appointed by the ICSDs.
The CSK will be Clearstream Banking Luxemburg or Euroclear Bank for securities that issuers wish to make potentially eligible as collateral for Eurosystem monetary policy or intraday credit operations, or the same entity as the CSP, for all other securities issued in NGN form.
 
Prolog for business processes of LVO:
CBL has been asked to establish a CSD in Luxemburg in partnership with the BCL. The name of the new company is LuxCSD S.A..
The Business flows for LuxCSD Global and Dematerialised Notes will be very similar to the existing New Global Notes (NGN) flows in an ICSD world. However, the legal forms (NGN, NSS), and the agent roles (CSP, CSK) that relate to the international market will not be used. Indeed, Business has requested LuxCSD to use its own terminology to avoid risk that LuxCSD participants and operations will become confused when information is mistakenly provided with the ICSD terminology.

AID143,Vestima+,Application,Not set,Minor,Major,Management of Investment funds,Major,Internal,onboarding,Vestima+,Critical,,"Vestima+ is an automated order-routing service that offers a single point of access to order issuers for in-house domestic, third-party, cross-border and off-shore funds.
Vestima+ is called the multi-domestic solution because it recognises the differences between domestic markets and the different needs that arise in each of them.
Vestima+ offers each market precisely what is required to increase the level of efficiency in investment fund processing, including :
· Forwarding orders from order issuers and passing instructions to the relevant order handling agent (in real time or batches)
· Routing order confirmation back to order issuers after receiving confirmation from order handling agents
· Issuing settlement instructions on behalf of participants to the relevant custodian or CSD (in real time or in batches) upon request.
By building on the existing infrastructure in both domestic and cross-border markets, Vestima+ protects investments already made by the market participants. This minimises the need for any new investment, while maximising the levels of automation and the consequent reduction in costs. All a user needs, to route orders and instructions electronically and most efficiently to multiple order issuers, order handling agents and custodians, is a web browser.
Vestima+ provides an open model enabling order issuers to freely choose their preferred,
most efficient settlement route and custody providers regardless of the market in which
they are located.
The network of order issuers has been expanded to include insurance companies and
asset managers, enabling STP for all participants.
Vestima+ also offers reference data management, reporting facilities and support for funds transfer instructions:
· A database of reference data with detailed information about all types of funds
· State of the art reporting functionality enabling timely and accurate trailer fee computation
· Automated handling of customer transfer instructions
IFRD “Investment Funds Reference Data” is a sub-module of Vestima allowing the Clearstream Operations to maintain the reference data for the funds transfer instructions. It is a web browser application allowing to:
· Create and update reference data,
· Bulk update of reference data
· Support several user profiles: read-only, standard, manager
